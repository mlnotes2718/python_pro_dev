# Python Pro Dev

A professional-grade Python project template demonstrating a complete development toolchain for production-quality code. Built with safety, correctness, and automation at every layer.

---

## Toolchain Overview

| Tool | Category | When It Runs |
|---|---|---|
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) / conda | Package & env management | Manual |
| [just](https://just.systems/) | Task runner | Manual |
| [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) | Linter + formatter | Pre-commit |
| [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) | Static type checker | Pre-push |
| [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) + [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/) | Testing + coverage | Pre-push |
| [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) | Property-based testing | Pre-push (via pytest) |
| [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) | Security linter | Pre-commit |
| [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) | Dependency vulnerability scan | Pre-push |
| [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) | Git hook orchestrator | On commit / push |
| [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | Secret scanning | Pre-commit + pre-push |

> **Upgrade path:** When moving to conda environments or containers, replace `pip-audit` with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) for deeper filesystem-level vulnerability scanning.

## Quick Start

### With uv (preferred)

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and set up the project
git clone <your-repo>
cd python-pro-dev
just setup
```

### With conda

```bash
# just setup auto-detects uv or conda
just setup
```

`just setup` installs all dependencies and registers pre-commit hooks in one step.

## Daily Workflow

```bash
just lint          # Fix style and lint issues (Ruff)
just typecheck     # Check types (mypy)
just test          # Run tests with coverage (pytest)
just sec           # Security scan (Bandit)
just audit         # Dependency CVE scan (pip-audit)
just health        # Check environment consistency
just precommit     # Run all pre-commit hooks manually
just run           # Run everything: lint → typecheck → health → audit → sec → test → clean
just clean         # Remove all cache and build artifacts
```

Git automation handles the rest:

- **On `git commit`** → Ruff, Bandit, Gitleaks, and standard file checks run automatically.
- **On `git push`** → mypy, pytest, pip-audit, and Gitleaks run automatically.

---

## Configuration

All tool configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`. No scattered config files.

```toml
[tool.ruff]        # Linting and formatting rules
[tool.mypy]        # Type checking strictness
[tool.pytest.ini_options]  # Test discovery and coverage
[tool.bandit]      # Security scan exclusions
[tool.coverage.report]     # Coverage reporting
```

See the `docs/` folder for a detailed guide on each tool's configuration and usage.

---

## Environment Strategy

This project uses **uv by default** and falls back to **conda** when uv is not available. The `justfile` detects the environment automatically:

```just
env_type := `[ -n "$CONDA_PREFIX" ] && echo "conda" || echo "uv"`
```

Every `just` command runs the correct tool transparently — you never need to think about which environment manager is active.

**Use conda when:**
- Working with packages that require compiled C/CUDA extensions (e.g. PyTorch, NumPy with MKL)
- Managing non-Python dependencies in the same environment

**Upgrade to Grype when:**
- Running containerised workloads (Docker, OCI images)
- Using conda environments where pip-audit has incomplete visibility
- You need OS-level package scanning, not just Python package scanning

---

## Detailed Docs

## Practical Adoption
There are too many tools and may cause tools fatigue. Will adopt tools in phase. The plans are as follows:

```text
Phase 1                → VSCode extension (Python, Jupyter, Colab, Code Spell Checker)
Phase 2                → VSCode extension (Github PR, Github Remote, Container Tools, Dev Container)
Phase 3                → VSCode extensions on security (Gitleaks, GitGuardian)
Phase 4 (now)          → pre-commit + gitleaks + just
Phase 5                → pip-audit + trivy                         -> VSCode ext available (recently exploited KIV)
Phase 6                → ruff + mypy + bandit                      -> ruff, mypy vscode ext available, ruff & bandit precommit remote available
Phase 7            → nbdime + nbqa
Phase 8            → pytest + coverage
Phase 9            → hypothesis + nbmake (notebook CI)
```

Will follow plans above and ruff and bandit can be checked remotely using precommit, will add to local install when required. For ruff we can use ruff extension first. this way we can reduce install foot print.
