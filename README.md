# Python Professional Development

This project tries to migrate Python project into a more professional style.

Please refer to `./docs` for all the references and notes

This repo is setup with uv and compatible with conda environment.

- For a start, we introduce linting and formatting. We use `ruff` as the defacto tool.
- Next we include `mypy` for static analysis on type hinting.
- Next we include `pytest` for testing

In the programming side:
- Look deeper into `try-except`
- Do not over-engineer or under-engineer class and function.
- Do not over-use and under-use lambda and list comprehension
- Use functional principal when writing function
